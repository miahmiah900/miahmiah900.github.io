<h1>The Open Source Software Primer</h1>
<p>by Jeremiah Swicegood</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>Imagine a world where programmers write software and give it away, a place where copyright infringement doesn't exist, and high quality programs are shared with anyone that is interested. This world is known as open source software, and if you are reading this document you are already part of it. </p>

<p>Over one third of all web sites rely on the open source operating system Linux. Almost one in four web sites use the open source software Wordpress, and thousands of other programs are available to use, modify and distribute, providing tools for graphics, databases, programming and more. The reach of open source software is undeniable, and its value is of global importance. ***</p>

<p>Every person that uses the internet has been affected by open source software, and the internet as we know it would not exist without the selfless efforts of developers giving away their time in pursuit of a common goal shared with others. Individuals that do not use the internet directly are also affected by a global culture shaped by the communication and collaboration made possible by the internet.</p>

<p>In his 1958 letter to his friend Hume, Hunter S. Thompson echoes Shakespeare, writing "And indeed, that is the question: whether to float with the tide, or to swim for a goal" (50). In the letter, Thompson is responding to Hume's request for advice, instead pointing out the choice to make your own path in life, even if it is against the flow. The pioneers of the open source software movement forged their own path, and today the world benefits from their dedication.</p>

<p>I think that being allowed the choice to swim for a goal or make your own path is important in the digital age, and that knowledge of open source software is both inspiring and required to make an informed decision.</p>

</div>

<div>

<h2>What is open source software?</h2>

<p>Each software program is written by one or more programmers, using coded language to instruct the computer or operating system. This set of instructions is called the source code. Be sure to note this key difference, that the source code is the origin of the software program. The software program by itself will operate on your computer, but without the source code, you cannot see how it was made or change it.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the effort involved in creating a software program is contained in the source code, and it can take a team of dozens of programmers years to write a sophisticated program like the Microsoft Windows operating system. The code written by the programmers is copyrighted, patented and kept secret so that other companies cannot copy the work and sell a similar product with minimal effort.</p>

<p>In contrast, open source software is made by programmers that share their source code, making it available for others to modify or copy. This culture of sharing has inspired millions of individuals to share their work and contribute their time, writing software programs, fixing errors and adding features to software made by others. </p>

<h2>What is software?</h2>

<p>To understand how the open source community works together, it is important to know exactly what software is. Software enables a user to control computer hardware, such as monitors, keyboards, and hard drives. Each computer is equipped with many software programs, one of which is an operating system. The operating system is responsible for managing all of the other software programs installed on the computer, which include a text editor or a web browser.</p>


</div>



<div>
<h2>Why do programmers make open source software?</h2>

<p>There are many reasons that people choose to participate in creating open source software, but the strongest theme is a spirit of collaboration. One major benefit of participating in the open source community is that there are thousands of other people giving their time to a variety of widely used software programs, so the return is much greater than the investment. Another common motivation is simply that the programmer enjoys writing software or troubleshooting problems. Others feel that open source software is the only alternative to what they view as unethical proprietary software and patents. Whatever the case, the programmers enrich their digital lives as they learn, practice and share programming techniques and code, working to provide tools for anyone to use. ***</p>
</div>


<div>
<h2>How did open source software begin?</h2>

<p>One of the first collaborative programming groups began In 1952, when the owners of the first commercial electronic computer by IBM worked together to make a set of software programs and formed the Project for Advancement of Coding Techniques. With further development of programming tools, the high cost of developing software was becoming more affordable. ***
</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric continued in this trend, and worked together towards the goal of cheaper computing for more than two decades. In 1979, a Bell Labs researcher named Dennis Ritchie described his vision for the Unix operating system that he was helping to develop, writing "What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing...is not just to type programs into a terminal...but to encourage close communication." ***</p>

<p>In 1958, the same year that Hunter S. Thompson's letter was written, an antitrust case forbade AT&T from selling computer products, and was ordered to license any of their technology not related to telephones. The result was that many universities contributed to the Unix source code that was shared free of charge. This collaboration continued until 1983, when another antitrust case separated AT&T from the Bell System companies. The chance presented itself for AT&T to turn Unix into a product, and the source code was officially closed and made proprietary. ***</p>

<p>At the same time, manufacturers began to stop distributing their source code, making it nearly impossible to learn from or modify. These complications and restrictions caused many programmers to seek another way, and one of these pioneers is Richard Stallman.</p>


<p>In 1984, Richard Stallman helped to form the idea of open source software when he founded the GNU Project with the goal of creating a Unix-like system composed of free software. Stallman believed that the users of software should be have the freedom to use, study, distribute and modify the software. In order to satisfy these conditions, software must provide the source code for each user. The critical concept here is that this idea of free software does not concern the cost of a product, but rather the freedoms guaranteed to the customer or end user. However, the nature of open source software does make it harder to sell and encourages a community that provides tools completely free of charge to everyone. ***

<h2>How does open source software affect the world?
</h2>
<p>The values of the Free Software Foundation play a major role in our global culture today. Open source software is a strong counterpoint to proprietary software and the world of patents and licenses.
</p>
<p>To better understand the implications of open source software versus proprietary software, let us examine a real world scenario in the United States farming industry. In a traditional farming community, tricks of the trade are shared and learned, with do-it-yourself repair skills required for the job. However, popular farm equipment such as John Deere products have begun to have sophisticated computers added to them, and the software that runs these computers is proprietary. ***
</p>
<p>No tool is ever perfect, and the software that runs a high tech tractor might encounter a bug or an unexpected situation. If the software is proprietary, the owner does not have access to the source code, and cannot repair the software bug to fix his tractor. Indeed, even the information that the tractor gathers is not made available, and the owner cannot modify the software to enable the machine to fulfill new roles. ***
</p>
<p>In response to this kind of product, farmers have worked together to build and share high tech, open source farming tools. One such community is Farm Hack, a website where plans for tools are shared, including open source software used to automate tasks. These tools enable independent farmers to compete with farms that use modern, proprietary equipment, without patents, restrictions or price tags. ***
</p>
<p>Another example is the environmental support provided by the United Nations in the form of the Open Foris initiative. The UN reports that "nearly 80 percent of developing countries have difficulty obtaining and using basic information about their forest resources" and have developed open source software to help collect and manage that information. ***
</p>
<p>In 2014, Ecuador and Tanzania used Open Foris to complete their first national forest inventory. Open source software is enabling people to address complex issues in their community such as climate change, land use, deforestation and biodiversity, and is an invaluable part of global collaboration. ***</p>
</div>



<div>
<h2>How is open source related to patents?</h2>

<p>The idea of granting users full access to source code is directly at odds with patent owning corporations. They have invested money in the development of trade secrets, and instead license use of their software, rather than grant ownership. The expectations of businesses and governments have been challenged by the idea of software, and this is another way that open source software and the free software movement have affected the world.</p>

<p>Richard Stallman can again be found at the source of an open source concept, when he created the GNU General Public License in 1989. Proprietary licenses include restrictions on the user, limiting what they can do with the software they have purchased and for how long. Contrary to this, the GNU license "guarantees end users...the freedoms to run, study, share, and modify the software" in addition to requiring that any further works derived from the software also include the GNU license. ***</p>

<p>This basic difference of freedoms is important to have represented in our world. It encourages a democratic way of working together to reach a common goal, and enables all people to benefit from the work of our global culture. The existence of the GNU General Public License and similar open source licenses have also enhanced the ongoing software patent debate. </p>

<p>Many people are taking political action to determine what can and cannot be patented in the realm of software. One one side are the supporters of software patents, claiming that software contains invention of functionality, and that the profits of such an invention should be protected by law. On the other side of the argument are those that say software is math, that algorithms should not be owned and secrecy is bad for everyone. Without the knowledge of software and open source software, people are not able to make an informed choice about patent laws and how they should be applied to the relatively new medium of software. ***</p>

<p>Hunter S. Thompson also writes in his 1958 letter, urging his friend Hume to find answers for himself, "Let's assume that you think you have a choice of eight paths to follow...and let's assume you can't see any real purpose in any of the eight. Then...you must find a ninth path" (51). Without the steps taken by Richard Stallman and his peers, for many of us there would not be a ninth path to follow when confronted on all sides by patents and licenses in a world run by software.</p>
</div>



<div>
<h2>Are there any reasons to not use open source software?</h2>

<p>Each piece of software is a tool, and just as each tool has a specific use and scenario that it is best suited for, so too does open source software. </p>

<p>The most common criticism for open source software is that it does not measure up in quality standards compared to proprietary software programs. Even when the open source software is available at no cost, there are many situations when the best tool for the job is proprietary software. Other complaints include that open source projects take too much time to complete, that there is no guarantee of support, and that security concerns are compromised. </p>

<p>Despite the problems that open source software can present in specific circumstances, it provides valuable competition to proprietary software and offers free or cheap alternatives. The simple fact of open source software existing at all provides a unique perspective on the software community, showing how restricting licenses and patents can hinder innovation and cooperation.</p>
</div>


<div>
<h2>What was that about the internet?</h2>

<p>Open source software and the internet have grown together hand in hand. The open standards of the internet were developed with the same spirit of collaboration that formed Unix as well as the Free Software Foundation and open source software. With further adoption of the internet, sharing software became easier and cheaper, enabling thousands of people across the world to work together on a single project. Today, the code sharing website GitHub engages a large population of the world's programmers at a single destination, with reports of more than 9 million users working on over 21 million open source projects. ***</p>

<p>Without the internet, many people including myself would not have any exposure to open source software. When the Mosaic web browser was released in 1993, the web gained the ability to display images alongside text, and I was hooked. I downloaded the tools needed to create web pages, and discovered the Linux open source operating system. Linux allowed me to learn about computers and express myself, later enabling me to help others make sense of the internet and manage their web sites.</p>

<p>For me, Linux stood out from the others with it's lack of a price tag and an active, welcoming community. Derived from MINIX, a variation of the popular Unix operating system that Dennis Ritchie from Bell Labs helped to develop, Linus Torvalds joined forces with the GNU Project that Richard Stallman created. The goal was to develop a free operating system to support the GNU licensed software that was still encumbered by Unix and MINIX, and Linux was released in 1991.</p>

<p>Now it is 2015, and Linux is the most popular operating system used to run web sites, with the help of open source packages that include Apache, MySQL and PHP. These open source tools enable this document to exist on the web and be available for you to read. Many of your favorite web sites and internet services also rely on these open source programs. ***</p>

<p>People, families, communities and the world are connected more closely than ever before by the internet, and without open source software, the internet would be a shadow of what it is today. The free software movement and open source software have helped make computing, communication and collaboration cheaper and more accessible. The ideals of open source software have challenged the existing mindsets and expectations of the world, showing new ways to work together and overcome problems. </p>

<p>I hope that you have been inspired as I have by the open source software movement, and that you are now equipped with some critical knowledge about the computerized world that we all share.</p>
