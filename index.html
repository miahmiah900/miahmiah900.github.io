<h2><a href="opensource.html">The Open Source Software Primer</a></h2>

<p>
Abstract
</p>

<p>
Inspired by the impact that open source software has on the world, Jeremiah Swicegood examines the history of the open source software movement, highlighting the benefits it provides to communities across the world and why it is important to understand it. The collaborative mindset of the open source community is reviewed and compared to Hunter S. Thompson's idea that there is always a choice to swim for a goal rather than float with the tide, and Swicegood shows that expectations are challenged as the open source software movement makes their own path, empowering the world to communicate and collaborate.
